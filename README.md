# 🌾🚨 F22-Raptors: Saving Farmers with AI — HackOrbit 2025

## 💔 Problem Statement

> **"One farmer dies by suicide every 41 minutes in India."**  
Most of these tragedies are caused by sudden, unexpected crop failures. Current tools are either too late, too unreliable, or require smartphones and literacy — leaving millions of small farmers helpless.

---

## 💡 Our Mission

Build an **AI system that stops farmer suicides before they happen**, using an ultra-accessible Telegram bot that works even on 2G networks.  
A single blurry photo or a simple text message can save a life.

---

## 🚀 Our AI-Driven Solution

### 📷 Crop Autopsy AI
Diagnoses pests, soil issues, and drought stress **from low-quality images** sent by farmers.  
✔ Works even with blurred or low-resolution images.  
✔ Suggests immediate actions to prevent crop failure.

---

### 🧠 Distress Signal AI
Monitors farmer group messages for suicidal intent or distress signals using **sentiment analysis and keyword detection**.  
✔ Instantly flags high-risk cases.  
✔ Alerts NGOs and government support teams to intervene.

---

### 🔮 Future Vision AI
Predicts **collapse zones up to 90 days in advance** using soil, pesticide, and groundwater data trends.  
✔ Proactive area-wide alerts.  
✔ Supports large-scale prevention campaigns.

## 💬 How It Works

1️⃣ Farmers send a **photo or text message** to our Telegram bot.  
2️⃣ Our AI engine analyzes it instantly:
- Crop Autopsy AI → Diagnose field problems.
- Distress Signal AI → Detect mental health emergencies.
- Future Vision AI → Predict future threats.  
3️⃣ Immediate solutions and NGO alerts are sent — **no app, no literacy, no extra steps.**

  - Rule-based prediction engine (forecasting)
- **Bot Interface:** Telegram Bot (python-telegram-bot library)
- **Frontend (planned demo UI)
- **Hosting:** Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend, if needed)
